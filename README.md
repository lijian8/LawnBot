Cutting grass manually is time consuming task and causes lot of fatigue for the
operator due to the vibrations and noise created. This study focuses on building a
battery powered autonomous lawn mower which can be used in residential and
corporate lawns, golf carts and playgrounds.

Existing machines in the market needs a guide wire around the lawn, does not
mowe in even pattern, cannot handle a inclination and very expensive. This study
will work to overcome all these limitations.

Sensor fusion technology is used to accurately estimate the state of the mower.
Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) based drive system is used to set the
velocity of the mower. A coverage path planning algorithm generated waypoints
are used to move the entire lawn.

The methodology proposed above adds a large list of advantages like even mowe
pattern (Like human controlled), automatic charging station docking, good
cutting efficiency, less cycle times, prevent accidents, user friendly humanmachine
interface, and high accuracy.

The objective of this work is to develop navigation, path-planning, obstacle
detection and human-machine interface modules for an autonomous lawn mower.
Developed modules are tested by fabricating lawn mower prototype. The
developed prototype is able to pass most of the test cases and working as expected
in test cases designed in view of India climate and soil conditions.
